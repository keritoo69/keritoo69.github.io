      Hey Karla, my beloved girl,

I know this might sound strange—or maybe even come out of nowhere—but I hope you’ll read this all the way through.

I don’t really know where to start. It might take me days to write this, but I’ll just let it all out. It's not that I lost feelings for you, or that I didn’t want to talk to you. Somehow, I just felt like stepping back was the right thing to do, and I’ve always followed my intuition. Like some kind of animal in the forest… empty, instinctual.

I grew up with this weird, hollow feeling that eventually became normal. I don’t even know what it was exactly, but I think it kept me going. I lived in the shadows—not knowing who I was or what I wanted. I followed others, avoided my own path, and that made life feel… meaningless sometimes.

But then you came into my life.

You made me realize so much. I truly loved you—and still do. I always will. Because you were the first person who made me feel something. You saw me. If I hadn’t met you, maybe I would’ve done something just to be remembered—something messed up, like those people who leave behind a signature just to prove they existed.

But you—you noticed me. You saw the emptiness in my eyes. No one else ever did. After all these years hiding behind a mask, you looked straight into me and saw the pain. And that means more than I can explain.

Even though you went through so much in life, through real pain, you still had the strength to see someone else. That’s rare. That’s beautiful.

Yes, I run from my other side. I’d rather keep moving than face it. Maybe that’ll change someday—or maybe not. Maybe I really am just a hopeless psycho. I don’t know. But what I do know is that I hurt you. I lied. I was distant. I wasn’t there when you needed me. And none of it was ever your fault.

You gave me a reason to live. I will never forget the kind of person you are—so full of strength and love, even when I didn’t deserve it.

I miss you. I will miss you forever.

I’m sorry for everything I did to you.

I’m just grateful to have known you, Karla.

My only love.
